# DataStructureandAlgorithms

I've tried to solve most of the DSA problems using algorithms that consumes less time and with efficient memory management.

Most of the contents are taken from my college curriculum and are programmed accordingly. You can create a pull and contribute to the project and grow this project more.

Programming Language : C/C++

Compiler : gcc v7.3.0, g++ v7.3.0

```c
Use Compiler that supports C11 (C standard revision) as many header files  are not included in older versions. [For more read here](https://github.com/becomingadarsha/DataStructureandAlgorithms/blob/master/myrequest.md) 
```

IDE used : I've compiled and tested using VS Code but you can try in any IDE like DevC++, Codeblocks,etc. 
(oh shit don't use Dev C++ or Turbo C it really sucks !)


Also don't forget to visit my website (blogs section)  where I will be posting the full explannation of codes published here.

Happy Coding!
